Why use twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers?

Because it simplifies binary addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  If we used signed magnitude to represent negative numbers, it would give incorrect results for binary addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  2's complement makes those opperations easily possible.  It also avoids the problematic value -0.
