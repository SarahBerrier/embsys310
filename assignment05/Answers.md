1. Create a function in “C” that allows swapping of two pointers.
   1.Explain what the “main” function does in order to setup the input arguments prior to calling the swap_pointer() function?
   1. What are the values in R0 & R1 when swap_pointer() is called?
   1. Share a screen shot of the local variables inside of “main” after the function swap_pointer() returns showing the values of the pointers and what they are pointing to (similar to the picture below).
