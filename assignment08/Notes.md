I didn't really understand how to figure any of this out.  
When I first went through STM32CubeMx, I didn't see the left hand categories for setting up the TIM2.  The Clock Configuration tab was super confusing for me.  I plan to do a deep dive into circuitry and electronics as I'm able.  
At first I wanted to just go for it and do both led lights.  But the options for PB14 didn't include channel 1 only channel 2.  I'm sure it would have been fine but I felt out of my element.  So I just went for one led.  
I don't understand the tutorial figures 221 or 222, or the text that came with them.   
The comments posted by Andrew in the following thread helped me out a lot.  Also the videos in the link Andrew posted.  They showed me the left hand categories for setting up TIM2 in STM32CubeMx.

Besides the above confusion.  :)  Thanks so much Tamer for a great course!  It has been very enjoyable and totally pushed me a lot which has been a nice change.
